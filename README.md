# Q3-decomposition
CliffordDecompose is aWolfram Mathematica application to help decompose operators in Clifford group by list of single or two qubit gates. All the elements in Clifford group preserves the conjugation of Pauli group. You can study by [2] for more details.   
## Requirement
CliffordDecompose requires Mathematica v13.0 or later and [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3).
## Installation
follow the below instrument step by step :
1. Install Q3 by following [Installation Guide](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3/blob/main/INSTALL.md) of [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3).
2. Launch Mathematica and activate "$UserBaseDirectory" and copy the link.
3. Open the link and click "Applications".
4. Paste "CliffordDecompose.wl" there.
## Guide
Open "CliffordDecomposeGuide.nb" to get detailed technical information about the application. It will give you guides and tutorials.
## Reference
This code is based on the below papers :
